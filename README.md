# ML_Chord_recognition
This project is a deep learning-based system for recognizing musical chords from audio files. The system processes audio, generates spectrograms, and trains a CNN-RNN model to classify chords. It also supports real-time chord recognition from audio input.

This script will:
- Load audio files from the dataset.
- Process them into spectrograms.
- Train the CNN-RNN model.
- Save the trained model to `chord_recognition_model.h5`.


I used "IDMT-SMT-GUITAR_V2" Dataset from fraunhofer website.
